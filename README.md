🔰 Mini Library Management System (Java – DSA Based)
  This project is a console-based Mini Library Management System developed in Java to demonstrate the practical application of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in a real-world scenario.
  Instead of using databases or frameworks, the system is built purely with core Java and data structures, making it ideal for academic learning and DSA practice.

🔧 Data Structures Used & Their Purpose
    Binary Search Tree (BST)
    Used to manage the book inventory.
    Enables efficient insertion, searching, and deletion of books based on book ID or name.

Queue (FIFO)
  Handles borrow requests from users.
  Ensures fair processing where requests are served in the order they arrive.

Stack (LIFO)
  Manages book returns.
  The most recently returned book is processed first, simulating real-world return handling.

Singly Linked List
  Stores user borrowing history, allowing sequential tracking of borrowed and returned books.

  🧾 DataBase Connection work's are goging on 
      Connect to Mysql + Java code file
      Java JDBC Connections

⚙️ Key Features
  Add, search, and remove books from the library
  Borrow and return books using proper request handling
  Track user borrowing history
  Efficient data handling using DSA concepts

Menu-driven, user-friendly console interface

🎯 Learning Outcomes
  Hands-on implementation of BST, Stack, Queue, and Linked List
  Understanding how different data structures solve specific problems
  Improved problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
  Strong foundation for advanced Java and system design projects

🛠️ Technologies Used
